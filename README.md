# SitBlinkSip

SitBlinkSip is a health-focused application designed to help developers and individuals who spend extended hours in front of a computer. This app monitors your body posture, tracks eye blinking patterns, and reminds you to take water breaks, promoting overall well-being during long work sessions.

## Problem Statement

Many developers and tech workers often forget to take care of their health while immersed in work. Common issues include:

- **Poor posture** leading to back and neck pain.
- **Eye strain** and dryness due to a lack of blinking.
- **Dehydration** from forgetting to take water breaks.

The goal of SitBlinkSip is to tackle these issues by providing timely reminders and real-time monitoring to ensure a healthy work routine.

## Objectives

- **Promote Healthy Posture**: Reduce the risk of back and neck pain by encouraging proper posture.
- **Prevent Eye Strain**: Avoid eye dryness and strain through timely blink reminders.
- **Encourage Hydration**: Prevent dehydration and fatigue by reminding users to take water breaks.
